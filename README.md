## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern.

```text
BlogSystem
│
├── Presentation Layer (API)
│
├── Application Layer
│   ├── UseCases
│   ├── DTOs
│
├── Domain Layer
│   ├── Entities
│   ├── Enums
│   ├── Interfaces
│   ├── Models
│
├── Infrastructure Layer
│   ├── EF Core
│   ├── Repositories
│   ├── Services
│
└── Persistence
    └── SQL Server
```

The architecture separates business rules from external concerns, making the application easier to maintain, test, and extend.
